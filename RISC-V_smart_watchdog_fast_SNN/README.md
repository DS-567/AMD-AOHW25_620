# Smart Watchdog Vivado ILA Overview üîç 

This repository contains the source code and implemtation files for a Vivado project with a ILA debug core synthesized, also submitted to the AMD Open Hardware Design Competition 2025. The smart watchdog operation when monitoring the RISC-V processor can be observed in detail by looking at the waveforms.

It features:
- A compressed design bitstream generated from Vivado.
- A debug probe file generated from Vivado.

### Short Decription

- The FPGA can be easily programmed using the Vivado design files through the hardware manager.
- The feature extraction process can be seen along with the SNN spiking activity.
- Smart watchdog class decisions can be observed after each instruction of a Fibonacci Series C application.
- Running hardware performance counters track the number of monitored instructions.

## Demonstrator Dependencies üìù

- Vivafo: **2023.1 was used to generate bitstream**
- FPGA platform: **AMD VC709 (Virtex-7)**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This design is hardware-dependent and will only run on the AMD VC709 FPGA board.

 ## Build Steps to Run the Vivado bitstream üî®

Steps must be performed in order.

**Step 1** - Download the repo zip file (if not already done so) and unzip.

**Step 2** - Open Vivado and then open the hardware manager.

**Step 3** - Power up the AMD VC709 FPGA board and plug in the JTAG USB cable to board and PC.

**Step 4** - Click *Open target* and *auto-connect* to the FPGA.

**Step 5** - Click *Program Device*. Browse for a *bitstream file* and select the following file:

`AMD-AOHW25_620/RISC-V_smart_watchdog_fast_SNN/riscv_watchdog_fast_design_2_compressed.bit`

Vivado should also automatically select the debug probes file from the same directory

`AMD-AOHW25_620/RISC-V_smart_watchdog_fast_SNN/debug_nets.ltx`

**Step 6** - Click *Program*.

‚úÖ Once the FPGA is programmed, the ILA waveform window should open after a short delay, completing the demonstrator build.
