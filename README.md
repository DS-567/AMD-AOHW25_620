# *From Brain-Inspiration to Silicon-Realisation:* SNN-based Smart Watchdogs for RISC-V Fault Detection

Team number: **AMD-AOHW25_620**

*Contribution to the AMD Open Hardware Design Competition 2025: Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based Smart Watchdogs for RISC-V Fault Detection*. This repository contains a complete prototype demonstrator of the smart watchdog with supporting documentation.

See the [report](/Report/) or the [publications](#6-publications-) for more details on the project. 

## Project Overview

With the complexity and miniscule feature sizes of modern processor architectures, temporary faults as a result of manufacturing defects and radiation-induced soft errors pose serious reliability concerns for CPUs deployed in safety-critical embedded applications. Fault detection mechanisms are required to monitor and detect faults to ensure hardware integrity. 

This project developed the first brain-inspired SNN-based ***smart watchdog***, capable of real-time monitoring and fault detection in embedded processors, inspired by desirable traits of the biological brain, such as *efficiency* and *dependability*. The smart watchdog was implemented on AMD FPGAs and validated with a real-world RISC-V processor, highlighting the effectiveness of AMD FPGA platforms for research applications.

## 1. Motivation üß†

- A watchdog should provide:
   -    ***Minimal power and area overheads***
   -    ***Effective fault detection***
   -    ***Robustness to failure***

- The human brain showcases:
   -    ***Efficient computation***
   -    ***Complex learning***
   -    ***Self-repairing capability***

- Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):
   -    Capture ***human brain dynamics*** most closely
   -    Offer more ***efficient*** and ***hardware-friendly computing***
   -    Realize ***self-repair*** via neuro-glial integration (astrocytes)
   -    Could form the basis of a novel, smarter watchdog mechanism!

**This PhD project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of SNNs for fault detection in a RISC-V processor architecture, with the objective of realising an efficient, but also more reliable watchdog circuit.**

## 2. Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è

A full ML workflow was developed from scratch in the PhD:
- Custom data collection hardware architecture created to gather training data
- Custom feature extraction algorithm
- SNN model trained using SNNTorch (~98% accuracy)
- Implemented the SNN model in VHDL and instantiated inside the smart watchdog
- Validated the smart watchdog concept on FPGA (retained ~98% accuracy)
- Created a final demonstrator of the smart watchdog on FPGA
