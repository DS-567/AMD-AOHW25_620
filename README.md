## Project Overview

With the complexity and miniscule feature sizes of modern processor architectures, temporary faults as a result of manufacturing defects and radiation-induced soft errors pose serious reliability concerns for CPUs deployed in safety-critical embedded applications. Fault detection mechanisms are required to monitor and detect faults to ensure hardware integrity. 

This project developed the first brain-inspired SNN-based ***smart watchdog***, capable of real-time monitoring and fault detection in embedded processors, inspired by desirable traits of the biological brain, such as *efficiency* and *dependability*. The smart watchdog was implemented on AMD FPGAs and validated with a real-world RISC-V processor, highlighting the effectiveness of AMD FPGA platforms for research applications.

## 1. Motivation üß†

- A watchdog should introduce:
   -    ***Minimal power and area overheads***
   -    ***Effective fault detection***
   -    ***Robustness to failure***

- The human brain showcases:
   -    ***Efficient computation***
   -    ***Complex learning***
   -    ***Self-repairing capability***

- Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):
   -    Capture ***human brain dynamics*** most closely
   -    Offer more ***efficient*** and ***hardware-friendly computing***
   -    Realise ***self-repair*** via neuro-glial integration (astrocytes)
   -    Could form the basis of a novel, smarter watchdog mechanism!

**This PhD project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of SNNs for fault detection in a RISC-V processor architecture, with the objective of realising an efficient, but also more reliable watchdog circuit.**

## 2. Methodology ‚öôÔ∏è

A full ML workflow was developed from scratch in the PhD:
- Custom data collection hardware architecture created to gather training data.
- Custom feature extraction algorithm.
- SNN model trained using SNNTorch (~98% accuracy).
- Implemented the SNN model in VHDL and instantiated inside the smart watchdog.
- Validated the smart watchdog concept on FPGA (retained ~98% accuracy).
- Created a final demonstrator of the smart watchdog on FPGA.

## 3. FPGA Implementation üíª

The smart watchdog has three main components: ***Control FSM***, ***feature extraction layer*** and the ***SNN***. It is instantiated beside a RISC-V CPU [(Neorv32)](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32) and monitors control flow in real time.

- During execution, RISC-V instruction data is written to a FIFO buffer.
- The Control FSM reads data from the FIFO to the feature layer.
- 16 binary features are extracted from each instruction, which are passed to the SNN as input data.
- The SNN classifies the instruction as either normal execution or a control flow error.
- This process repeats until there all instructions have been classified (i.e. FIFO is empty).

Full details of the smart watchdog implementation can be seen in the [report](/Report.pdf).

‚úîÔ∏è The smart watchdog doesn't require any hardware modifications when compiling different C code on Neorv32

‚úîÔ∏è The smart watchdog can detect faults that the RISC-V architecture fails to (no exception / trap).

‚ùï Note, as described in the report there are 2 different hardware implementations of the SNN. The Fast SNN source code can be found in the [Demonstrator](/Demonstrator) and the SNN (time-mux) can be found in the [Reference_SNN_HDL folder](/Reference_SNN_HDL).

## 4. Builds üöÄ

There are 4 source codes provided in this repository for building:

### 1. Smart Watchdog Demonstrator

A demonstrator was created and presented at ISCAS 2025, which deployed the developed smart watchdog on FPGA to monitor the Neorv32 processor executing a motor control task, resembling a safety-critical and realistic workload. Custom PCBs and a Python GUI were created to interface with the demo and to visualise data and performance. Faults can be injected into the RISC-V program counter to realise control flow errors during program execution. The smart watchdog reponse and fault detection capability can be observed in great detail.

An additional detailed video of the demonstrator can be found: [Demonstrator Video](https://youtu.be/D4o1u4qUvNw)

### 2. Data Collection Framework

To train any neural network, high quality training data is required. A custom hardware architecture was created with AMD FPGAs in this PhD to collect data from a real-world RISC-V softcore (Neorv32), facilitating fault injection and data extraction off-FPGA.

### 3. Software Model to Hardware Framework

Implementing a trained model on FPGA can require some consideration. The simple framework of extracting key parameters from a SNN model to then be implemented in Vivado is shared.

### 4. Smart Watchdog Vivado ILA Core 

A Vivado bitstream and ILA debug files are provided to observe the smart watchdog running in hardware alongisde the RISC-V CPU and verify spike patterns with a spike plot from the SNNTorch software model.
